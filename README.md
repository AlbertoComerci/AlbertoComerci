## Hi, I'm Alberto👋

Full Stack Developer, graduating in Software Engineering, with a strong specialization in Backend development. I recently managed the entire backend lifecycle of a complex web application, implementing authentication systems, data management, Stripe payment integration, and automations with external APIs such as Brevo and Make.com.
My background in digital arts gives me a unique approach to problem-solving, combining analytical thinking and creativity to develop robust and efficient solutions.
Every day I strive to learn something new... and I never intend to stop.
